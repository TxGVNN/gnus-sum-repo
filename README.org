* Story
Someday, I join an IT company that is the first outsourcing company I work.
They have many policies to protect the products. I'm not allowed to store anything in the internet service.
It's fine, but they also don't provide the storage services for employees.

I need to store my notes, tips around work. Good, I found a solution to store my stuff. All of the company will provide to you an email account.

IMAP, that's it (~APPEND~ Command) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#section-6.3.11 can handle this.

* How did I implenment?

I use GNUS to work around email. This is why I have this package.
